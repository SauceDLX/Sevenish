This is my main font project. Within the limitation of having letter bodies be about seven pixels tall (emphasis on about, hence the -ish in Sevenish), I want to include a wide support of languages and writing systems in this font. Because I'm only fluent in languages that use the Latin script, I don't have much of an intuition for what is legible and looks good in many of these writing systems. If you have experience with any of these and want to give feedback, I would appreciate it very much. 

Sevenish.ttf is the main variant, it includes decent support of Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Kana, Hangul, Thai, Greek, Hebrew, Armenian, Georgian, as well as limited/untested support for Devanagari, Ge'ez, Thaana and sitelen pona.
Sevenish_SP.ttf is focused specifically on sitelen pona. It is entirely monospaced and uses latin ligatures to make it easier to type sitelen pona. Besides that, it only includes basic ASCII.
